<h2>01-BasicLayout-IntroJS </h2>
    <p>In Step 1, I delved into the study of 'HTML' and 'CSS,' covering topics such as Grid and Flex in CSS, along with an introduction to JavaScript. In this step, I undertook a project to design a Windows 10 calculator, and I will share its demo and GitHub link with you.</p>

<h2>Step 2. Advanced Layout - Basic JS </h2>    
<p>During the second step, I delved into the principles of responsive web design and initiated my exploration of JavaScript, alongside gaining proficiency in debugging techniques. A significant task during this step involved enhancing the responsiveness of our previously designed Calculator.</p>

<h2>Step 3. Intermediate JS (I)</h2>

<p>In the third step, the focus shifted towards a deeper exploration of JavaScript concepts, particularly emphasizing scopes, functions, and block scopes. Additionally, we familiarized ourselves with Chrome Dev Tools to enhance our debugging capabilities. A key task in this phase involved extending the functionality of our Calculator to include operators comparable to those in the Windows 10 calculator. Furthermore, I introduced themes with a palette of five colors: green, blue, purple, black, and white, enhancing the aesthetic appeal and customization options. Moreover, as part of the assignment, we were tasked with creating a To-Do App, wherein I developed a To-Do App inspired by the design principles of Windows 11.</p>

      </ol>
</br>

<h2>Step 4. Intermediate JS (II)</h2>

<p>In the fifth step, the focus shifted towards mastering SASS and LESS, two powerful CSS preprocessors, while delving deeper into JavaScript concepts such as hoisting and scope closures. During this stage, I leveraged this newfound knowledge to develop a comprehensive To-Do App equipped with functionalities enabling users to categorize tasks as "all," "active," or "complete," thereby enhancing its usability and versatility.

  Additionally, I undertook the task of revamping our Calculator using SASS, a task that not only improved its aesthetic appeal but also allowed for more efficient and maintainable styling.</p>
