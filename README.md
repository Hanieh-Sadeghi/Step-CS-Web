    <p>In Step 1, I delved into the study of 'HTML' and 'CSS,' covering topics such as Grid and Flex in CSS, along with an introduction to JavaScript. In this step, I undertook a project to design a Windows 10 calculator, and I will share its demo and GitHub link with you.</p>

In Step 2, I delved into the study of JavaScript, gaining a solid introduction and deepening my understanding through practical coding. Simultaneously, I focused on creating responsive CSS. Integrating this newfound knowledge, I enhanced my Step 1 calculator project with responsive CSS components.
